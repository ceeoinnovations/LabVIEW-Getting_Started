# LabVIEW-Getting_Started
 Here are a bunch of example VIs to get started using LabVIEW.  They start with the easier tasks and get progressively harder.  The higher numbers were specifically designed for my class that used LabVIEW with arduinos and other micorprocessors.
 
 # Getting Started
  1. download the zip file
  2. unzip it and run the Start_Here.vi (for all versions of LabVIEW 2019 and later)
  3. you will see a dropdown list of possible examples to look at - start with the first one and go from there.

# Hints
1. use the execution highlighting to see how the program runs
2. remember that in LabVIEW, things not connected together on the diagram will try and run at the same time
3. Controls are for you to tell the code something and indicators are for the code to tell you something (z = x + y >> z is an indicator and x,y are controls as you have to define them).
